# What is CharacterCreator?
When devloping a story, often times it can become challenging to track characters and their backstories. This project is meant to address this problem by providing a centralized place for those to store their character information. A user is able to view and add to a list of stories. Within each story, the user has the option to add a character to that story by providing the character's name, age, home, and general description.
